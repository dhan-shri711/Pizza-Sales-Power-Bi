# Data Analyst Portfolio Project: Pizza Sales Analysis
 
## Introduction
This project aims to analyze pizza sales data to gain insights into business performance using SQL for data querying and Power BI for visualization. The project includes steps from importing raw data into SQL to creating insightful visualizations in Power BI.
 
## Steps in Project
1. **Importing Data into SQL**: The raw data will be imported into a SQL database for analysis. This step involves setting up the database schema and importing the data.
2. **SQL Queries for KPIs**: SQL queries will be written to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas Per Order.
3. **SQL Queries for Daily and Monthly Trends**: Additional SQL queries will be written to analyze daily and monthly trends in total orders and hourly trends in order volumes.
4. **SQL Queries for Percentage of Sales by Category & Size**: Queries will be developed to determine the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza categories and sizes.
5. **SQL Queries for Top 5 & Bottom 5**: Queries will be crafted to identify the top 5 best-selling and bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quantity, and total orders.
6. **Power BI Intro**: An introduction to Power BI will be provided, highlighting its capabilities in data visualization and analysis.
7. **Connecting Power BI to SQL DB**: The SQL database will be connected to Power BI for data extraction and visualization.
8. **Data Cleaning using Power Query**: Power Query will be utilized for data cleaning and transformation tasks.
9. **Building KPIs**: KPIs such as Total Revenue, Average Order Value, and others will be calculated within Power BI.
10. **Data Processing in Power BI**: Further data processing steps will be performed within Power BI to prepare the data for visualization.
11. **Building Daily and Monthly Trend Charts**: Visualizations, including bar charts for daily trend of total orders and line charts for monthly trend of total orders, will be created.
12. **Building % of Sales by Category & Size**: Pie charts representing the percentage of sales by pizza category and size will be generated.
13. **Adding Insights**: Insights and interpretations will be added to the visualizations to provide meaningful analysis.
14. **Worst and Best Sellers Dashboard**: Bar charts highlighting the top 5 best-selling and bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas will be created.
15. **Add Navigator Buttons**: Navigation buttons will be added to facilitate user interaction within the Power BI dashboard.
